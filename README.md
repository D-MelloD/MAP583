# Deep_s2s_Learn
This repository contains implementation of research papers on sequence-to-sequence learning. Currently the following implementations are supported:
- Machine translation (following [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04025.pdf) paper)
- Handwriting synthesis (following [Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf) paper)
